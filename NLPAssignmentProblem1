# 2 The prompt is 

The following transcript contains statements made by speakers in a meeting. Your task is to analyze the sentiment of each speaker's statement and correlate it with the financial data for the same period. Specifically, you need to identify whether the sentiment expressed by each speaker is positive or negative, and then validate that sentiment with the corresponding financial data for the quarter. If the sentiment is positive and the revenue from operations has increased, or if the sentiment is negative and the revenue has decreased, consider it a match. Output a JSON structure that mentions which speaker's statement led to the sentiment conclusion.

Robbie Singh:: "We do not specifically look at it like too much on what is the competitive advantage or what is
not. India is going to be a very significant data market and it will have lot more than just 1 or 2
players. We would like to be one of the leading players and the full-service data center, and the
various data center, edge data centers etc., so in each aspect we would like to be a significant
player. So, currently, we have order book, other than the operating order book, of over 110
Megawatt of hyperscalers and we expect that to rise dramatically over the next couple of years.
We would be well on the way to completing 1 gigawatt before the end of this decade."
Speaker 2: "And lastly, sir what are our CAPEX plans especially for green hydrogen, airports and data center
segments for the next 3 years?"
Speaker 3: "Overall in the longer term, the CAPEX plans donâ€™t alter for the asset like for green hydrogen
full 3-million-ton facility, approximately $50 billion as we have outlined in previous year, so
that plan continues forward as it is. Also this year, we would touch just about between 300
million to 400 million and then it rapidly starts rising from next year and the year after. On the airport side, we will have capex this year just about US $1.1 billion, all of this just to clarify we
are assuming Rs.80 to a dollar rate, adjust for that, so about US $1.1 billion this year would be
the CAPEX on airport. It will broadly remain in that range for the next year then there will be
decline, once we complete the first phase of our development plan in airports."
